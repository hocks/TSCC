.SH NAME
mpiexec-redir-helper \- Helper code for mpiexec

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B mpiexec-redir-helper
\fIexecutable\fR [args]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This code is a helper binary for
.BR mpiexec (1),
used in situations where the resource manager does not support standard
IO stream redirection.  It should never be invoked directly, but only
through invocations of mpiexec.

Support inside the resource manager is required to connect the standard
streams of parallel processes, file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, called stdin,
stdout, and stderr.  Most recent distributions of OpenPBS and Torque do
support this and will not need mpiexec-redir-helper.  PBSPro, however, is a
commercial PBS-like resource manager that does not include support for
standard stream redirection.  This program is used to work around this
limitation of PBSPro.

When
.BR mpiexec (1)
is configured with the option \fI--enable-pbspro-helper\fR, this binary
is generated as part of the build process.  Also, mpiexec will invoke
this binary in front of the user's application code when it spawns the
tasks.  After connecting the standard streams, mpiexec-redir-helper
execs the user application, and the parallel job continues as normal.

.SH OPTIONS
None.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
Mpiexec communicates the hostname on which it is running and up to three
port numbers to be used for each of the three standard streams via
environment variables.  They are not intended to be set by users.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 0.6i
mpiexec-redir-helper: Error: no environment variable "MPIEXEC_HOST".
.TP
This program really should only ever be invoked via mpiexec.
