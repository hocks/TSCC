%description
Mpiexec gathers node settings from PBS, prepares for the MPI library run
environment, and starts tasks through the PBS task manager interface.
Attempts to duplicate mpirun as much as possible, while getting everything
correct, and being faster than rsh.  As a side effect, PBS maintains
proper accounting of all tasks of a parallel job, and can terminate
everything on job abort.

%setup -q

#
# The default PBS location is --with-pbs=/usr/local/pbs
# You may want to change it for your actual PBS install path.
#
# If (and only if) using PBSPro, be sure to add --enable-pbspro-helper.
#
# The default MPI library type is GM, but you can change that here.
# You can override it at runtime, too, with, e.g. "--comm=ib".
